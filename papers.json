We present a pipeline that automates the segmentation and measurement of matching lesions, given a point annotation in the baseline lesion. First, a region around the point annotation is extracted, in which a deep-learning-based segmentation of the lesion is performed. Afterward, a registration algorithm finds the corresponding image region in the follow-up scan and the convolutional neural network segments lesions inside this region. In the final step, the corresponding lesion is selected. We evaluate our pipeline on clinical follow-up data comprising 125 soft-tissue lesions from 43 patients with metastatic melanoma. Our pipeline succeeded for $96\\%$ of the baseline and $80\\%$ of the follow-up lesions, showing that we have laid the foundation for an efficient quantitative follow-up assessment in clinical routine.",

        "abstract": "Accurate segmentation of volumetric scans like MRI and CT scans is highly demanded for surgery planning in clinical practice, quantitative analysis, and identification of disease. However, accurate segmentation is challenging because of the irregular shape of given organ and large variation in appearances across the slices. In such problems, 3D features are desired in nature which can be extracted using 3D convolutional neural network (CNN). However, 3D CNN is compute and memory intensive to implement due to large number of parameters and can easily over fit, especially in medical imaging where training data is limited. In order to address these problems, we propose a distillation-based depth shift module (Distill DSM). It is designed to enable 2D convolutions to make use of information from neighbouring frames more efficiently. Specifically, in each layer of the network, Distill DSM learns to extract information from a part of the channels and shares it with neighbouring slices, thus facilitating information exchange among neighbouring slices. This approach can be incorporated with any 2D CNN model to enable it to use information across the slices with introducing very few extra learn-able parameters. We have evaluated our model on BRATS 2020, heart, hippocampus, pancreas and prostate dataset. Our model achieves better performance than 3D CNN for heart and prostate datasets and comparable performance on BRATS 2020, pancreas and hippocampus dataset with simply 28\\% of parameters compared to 3D CNN model.

        "abstract": "Acute ischemic stroke is caused by a blockage in the cerebral arteries, resulting in long-term disability and sometimes death. To determine the optimal treatment strategy, a patient-specific assessment is often based on advanced neuroimaging data, such as spatio-temporal (4D) CT Perfusion (CTP) imaging. To date, perfusion maps are typically calculated from 4D CTP data and then thresholded to localize and quantify the stroke lesion core and tissue-at-risk. A few studies have recently developed deep learning methods to predict stroke lesion outcomes from perfusion maps. The basic idea of these is to train a model, using perfusion maps acquired at baseline and their corresponding follow-up images acquired several days after treatment, to automatically estimate the final lesion location and volume in new patients. Nevertheless, model training based on the original 4D CTP scans might be desirable, as they could contain more valuable information not directly represented in perfusion maps. Therefore, we aimed to develop and evaluate a temporal convolutional neural network (TCN) to predict stroke lesion outcomes directly from 4D CTP datasets acquired at admission, without computing any perfusion maps. Using a total of 176 CTP scans, we investigated the impact of the time window size by training the proposed TCN on various numbers of CTP frames: 8, 16, and 32 time points. For comparison purposes, we also trained a convolutional neural network based on perfusion maps. The results show that the model trained on 32 time points yielded significantly higher Dice values (0.33$\\pm$0.21) than the models trained on 8 time points (0.25$\\pm$0.20; P$<$0.05), 16 time points (0.28$\\pm$0.21; P$<$0.001), and perfusion maps (0.23$\\pm$0.18; P$<$0.05). These experiments demonstrate that the proposed model effectively extracts spatio-temporal data from CTP scans to predict stroke lesion outcomes, which leads to better results than using perfusion maps.

        "abstract": "Standard losses for training deep segmentation networks could be seen as individual classifications of pixels, instead of supervising the global shape of the predicted segmentations. While effective, they require exact knowledge of the label of each pixel in an image. \n\nThis study investigates how effective global geometric shape descriptors could be, when used on their own as segmentation losses for training deep networks. Not only interesting theoretically, there exist deeper motivations to posing segmentation problems as a reconstruction of shape descriptors: First, annotations to obtain approximations of low-order shape moments could be much less cumbersome than their full-mask counterparts, and anatomical priors could be readily encoded into invariant shape descriptions, which might alleviate the annotation burden. Also, some shape descriptors could be readily used to ``encode'' biomarkers, leading to better interpretability. Finally, and most importantly, we hypothesize that, given a task, certain shape descriptions might be invariant across image acquisition protocols/modalities and subject populations, which might open interesting research avenues for generalization in medical image segmentation.\n\nWe introduce and formulate a few shape descriptors in the context of deep segmentation, and evaluate their potential as stand-alone losses on two different, challenging tasks. Inspired by recent works in constrained optimization for deep networks, we propose a way to use those descriptors to supervise segmentation, without any pixel-level label. Very surprisingly, as little as 4 descriptors values per class can approach the performance of a segmentation mask with 65k individual discrete labels. We also found that shape descriptors can be a valid way to encode anatomical priors about the task, enabling to leverage expert knowledge without requiring additional annotations. Our implementation is publicly available and can be easily extended.",

Performance metrics are key for objective, transparent and comparative performance assessment, but little attention has been given to their pitfalls. Under the umbrella of the Helmholtz Imaging Platform (HIP), three international initiatives - the MICCAI Society's challenge working group, the Biomedical Image Analysis Challenges (BIAS) initiative, as well as the benchmarking working group of the MONAI framework - have now joined forces with the mission to generate best practice recommendations with respect to metrics in medical image analysis. Consensus building is achieved via a Delphi process, a popular tool for integrating opinions in large international consortia. The current document serves as a teaser for the results presentation and focuses on the pitfalls of the most commonly used metric in biomedical image analysis, the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), in the categories of (1) mathematical properties/edge cases, (2) task/metric fit and (3) metric aggregation. Being compiled by a large group of experts from more than 30 institutes worldwide, we believe that our framework could be of general interest to the MIDL community and will improve the quality of biomedical image analysis algorithm validation.

Developing automatic deep learning (DL) algorithms for this task requires annotated images of the ribs at pixel-level. However, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no such public datasets as well as benchmark protocols for performance evaluation. To solve this problem, we establish a new CXR dataset, namely VinDr-RibCXR, for automatically segmenting and labeling of individual ribs. The VinDr-RibCXR contains 245 posteroanterior CXRs with corresponding segmentation annotations for each rib provided by human experts. Furthermore, we train the state-of-the-art DL-based segmentation models on 196 images from the RibCXR and report performance of those models on an independent test set of 49 images. Our best performing DL model (i.e., Nested U-Net with EfficientNet-B0)  obtains  a  Dice  score  of  0.834 (95% CI, 0.810-0.853). The  sensitivity,  specificity  and  Hausdorff distance are 0.841 (95% CI, 0.812-0.858), 0.998 (95% CI, 0.997-0.998), and 15.453 (95% CI, 13.340-17.450), respectively. These results demonstrate a high-level of performance in labeling of the individual ribs from CXRs. Our study, therefore, serves as a proof of concept and baseline performance for future research. The dataset, codes, and trained DL models will be made publicly available to encourage new advances in this research direction.",

Specifically for neurosurgical data, challenges arise from visual conditions such as strong blur and from an unknowingly large variety of instrument types. For neurosurgical domain, instrument localization methods must generalize across different sub-disciplines such as cranial tumor and aneurysm surgeries which exhibit different visual properties. We present and evaluate a methodology towards robust instrument tip localization for neurosurgical microscope data, formulated as coarse saliency prediction. For our analysis, we build a comprehensive dataset comprising in-the-wild data from several neurosurgical sub-disciplines as well as phantom surgeries. Comparing single stream networks using either image or optical flow information, we find complementary performance of both networks. Plain optical flow enables better cross-domain generalization, while the image-based network performs better on surgeries from the training domain. Based on these findings, we present a two-stream architecture that fuses image and optical flow information to utilize the complementary performance of both. Being trained on tumor surgeries, our architecture outperforms both single stream networks and shows improved robustness on data from different neurosurgical sub-disciplines. From our findings, future work must focus more on how to incorporate optical flow information into fusion architectures to further improve cross-domain generalization.",

To address this, we propose a novel weakly-supervised segmentation strategy capable of better capturing 3D shape prior in both model prediction and learning. Our main idea is to extract a self-taught shape representation by leveraging weak labels, and then integrate this representation into segmentation prediction for shape refinement. To this end, we design a deep network consisting of a segmentation module and a shape denoising module, which are trained by an iterative learning strategy. Moreover, we introduce a weak annotation scheme with a hybrid label design for volumetric images, which improves model learning without increasing the overall annotation cost. The empirical experiments show that our approach outperforms existing SOTA strategies on three organ segmentation benchmarks with distinctive shape properties.

This FiLM adaptation enables integrating metadata into segmentation models for better performance. We observed an average Dice score increase of 5.1% on spinal cord tumor segmentation when incorporating the tumor type with FiLM. The metadata modulates the segmentation process through low-cost affine transformations applied on feature maps which can be included in any neural network's architecture. Additionally, we assess the relevance of segmentation FiLM layers for tackling common challenges in medical imaging: training with limited or unbalanced number of annotated data, multi-class training with missing segmentations, and model adaptation to multiple tasks. Our results demonstrated the following benefits of FiLM for segmentation: FiLMed U-Net was robust to missing labels and reached higher Dice scores with few labels (up to 16.7%) compared to single-task U-Net.

Among several alternative of SGD the most popular are AdaGrad, AdaDelta, RMSProp and Adam which scale coordinates of the gradient by square roots of some form of averaging of the squared coordinates in the past gradients and automatically adjust the learning rate on a parameter basis. In this work, we compare Adam based variants based on the difference between the present and the past gradients, the step size is adjusted for each parameter. We run several tests benchmarking proposed methods using medical image data. The experiments are performed using ResNet50 architecture neural network. Moreover, we have tested ensemble of networks and the fusion with ResNet50 trained with stochastic gradient descent. To combine the set of ResNet50 the simple sum rule has been applied. Proposed ensemble obtains very high performance, it obtains accuracy comparable or better than actual state of the art.

        "abstract": "In recent years, the availability of digitized Whole Slide Images (WSIs) has enabled the use of deep learning-based computer vision techniques for automated disease diagnosis. However, WSIs present unique computational and algorithmic challenges. WSIs are gigapixel-sized ($\\sim$100K pixels), making them infeasible to be used directly for training deep neural networks. Also, often only slide-level labels are available for training as detailed annotations are tedious and can be time-consuming for experts. Approaches using multiple-instance learning (MIL) frameworks have been shown to overcome these challenges. Current state-of-the-art approaches divide the learning framework into two decoupled parts: a convolutional neural network (CNN) for encoding the patches followed by an independent aggregation approach for slide-level prediction. In this approach, the aggregation step has no bearing on the representations learned by the CNN encoder. We have proposed an end-to-end framework that clusters the patches from a WSI into ${k}$-groups, samples ${k}'$ patches from each group for training, and uses an adaptive attention mechanism for slide level prediction; Cluster-to-Conquer (C2C). We have demonstrated that dividing a WSI into clusters can improve the model training by exposing it to diverse discriminative features extracted from the patches. We regularized the clustering mechanism by introducing a KL-divergence loss between the attention weights of patches in a cluster and the uniform distribution. The framework is optimized end-to-end on slide-level cross-entropy, patch-level cross-entropy, and KL-divergence loss.",

However, these studies focused on only a single type of procedure. In this work, we analyze, for the first time, surgical step recognition on four different laparoscopic surgeries: Cholecystectomy, Right Hemicolectomy, Sleeve Gastrectomy, and Appendectomy. Inspired by the traditional apprenticeship model, in which surgical training is based on the Halstedian method, we paraphrase the \u201csee one, do one, teach one\u201d approach for the surgical intelligence domain as \u201ctrain one, classify one, teach one\u201d. In machine learning, this approach is often referred to as transfer learning. To analyze the impact of transfer learning across different laparoscopic procedures, we explore various time-series architectures and examine their performance on each target domain. We introduce a new architecture, the Time-Series Adaptation Network (TSAN), an architecture optimized for transfer learning of surgical step recognition, and we show how TSAN can be pre-trained using self-supervised learning on a Sequence Sorting task. Such pre-training enables TSAN to learn workflow steps of a new laparoscopic procedure type from only a small number of labeled samples from the target procedure. Our proposed architecture leads to better performance compared to other possible architectures, reaching over 90% accuracy when transferring from laparoscopic Cholecystectomy to the other three procedure types. \n",

        "abstract": "Automated analyses of chest imaging in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have largely focused on a single timepoint, usually at disease presentation, and have not explicitly taken into account temporal disease manifestations. We present a deep learning-based approach for prediction of imaging progression from serial chest radiographs (CXRs) of COVID-19 patients. Our method first utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction from patches within the concerned lung zone, and also from neighboring areas to enhance the contextual phenotypic information. The framework further incorporates two distinct spatio-temporal Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) modules for effective predictions. The first LSTM module captures spatial dependencies between patches and the second exploits the temporal context of sequential CXR scans. The resulting network focuses on critical image regions that provide relevant information for learning the progression of lung infiltrates without the explicit need for infiltrate segmentation. The second LSTM provides an encoded context vector used as an input to a decoder module to predict future severity grades. Our novel multi-institutional dataset comprises sequential CXR scans from N=100 patients. Specifically, our framework predicts zone-wise disease severity for a patient on the last day by learning representations from the previous temporal CXRs. We design two baseline approaches - one using fine-tuned VGG-16 features and the other using radiomic descriptors. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms both baselines in average accuracy by 10.33% and 12.16%, respectively, in predicting COVID-19 progression severity.",

        "abstract": "Images offer a two-dimensional (2D) representation of a three-dimensional (3D) environment. However, in many biomedical tasks, a 3D view is crucial for diagnosis. Projecting structured light, such as a regular laser grid, onto the surface of interest allows to reconstruct its 3D structure. For reconstruction, it is crucial to correctly identify and assign each laser ray to its respective position in the laser grid. Current methods for this task use semi-automatic, yet highly manual annotations. Hence, a fully automatic, reliable method is desired. Here, we show that this assignment can be approached as an image registration. We first separate the laser rays from the background using semantic segmentation. We found that registration of the extracted laser rays directly to the fixed laser grid image fails, when we use state-of-the-art intensity-based image registration techniques, such as ANTs. Using our feature-based custom loss and a deep neural network, we are able to use a U-Net-like architecture to compute deformation fields to successfully register the laser rays onto the fixed image accompanied with a custom post-processing sorting step. Using synthetic data, we show that the network is in general able to learn affine and non-linear transformations. Our method is also robust to missing or occluded rays. Using an ex vivo dataset, we achieved an registration accuracy of 91%. In summary, we provide a new platform to perform feature-based registration and showcase this on a biomedical dataset. In future, we will evaluate different architectural designs and more complex datasets. ",

Making use of open-source data for pre-training or using domain adaptation can be a way to overcome this issue. However, pre-trained networks often fail to generalize to new test domains that are not distributed identically due to variations in tissue stainings, types, and textures. Additionally, current domain adaptation methods mainly rely on fully-labeled source datasets. In this work, we propose Self-Rule to Adapt (SRA) which takes advantage of self-supervised learning to perform domain adaptation and removes the burden of fully-labeled source datasets. SRA can effectively transfer the discriminative knowledge obtained from a few labeled source domain to a new target domain without requiring additional tissue annotations. Our method harnesses both domains\u2019 structures by capturing visual similarity with intra-domain and cross-domain self-supervision. We show that our proposed method outperforms baselines across diverse domain adaptation settings and further validate our approach to our in-house clinical cohort.",

While contrastive learning has demonstrated promising results on natural image classification tasks, its application to medical imaging tasks like chest X-ray interpretation has been limited. In this work, we propose MoCo-CXR, which is an adaptation of the contrastive learning method Momentum Contrast (MoCo), to produce models with better representations and initializations for the detection of pathologies in chest X-rays. In detecting pleural effusion, we find that linear models trained on MoCo-CXR-pretrained representations outperform those without MoCo-CXR-pretrained representations, indicating that MoCo-CXR-pretrained representations are of higher-quality. End-to-end fine-tuning experiments reveal that a model initialized via MoCo-CXR-pretraining outperforms its non-MoCo-CXR-pretrained counterpart. We find that MoCo-CXR-pretraining provides the most benefit with limited labeled training data. Finally, we demonstrate similar results on a target Tuberculosis dataset unseen during pretraining, indicating that MoCo-CXR-pretraining endows models with representations and transferability that can be applied across chest X-ray datasets and tasks.",

One way to study the tumor microenvironment is to characterize the spatial interactions between various types of nuclei in cancer tissue from H&E whole slide images, which require nucleus segmentation and classification. Current methods of nucleus classification rely on extensive labeling from pathologists and are limited by the number of categories a nucleus can be classified into. In this work, leveraging existing nucleus segmentation and contrastive representation learning methods, we developed a method that learns vector embeddings of nuclei based on their morphology in histopathology images. We show that the embeddings learned by this model capture distinctive morphological features of nuclei and can be used to group them into meaningful subtypes. These embeddings can provide a much richer characterization of the statistics of the spatial distribution of nuclei in cancer and open new possibilities in the quantitative study of the tumor microenvironment.",

Detection of abdominal adhesions on cine-MRI is challenging from both a radiological and deep learning perspective.

We experimented with spatio-temporal deep learning architectures centered around a ConvGRU architecture. A hybrid architecture comprising a ResNet followed by a ConvGRU model allows to classify a whole time-series. Compared to a stand-alone ResNet with a two time-point (inspiration/expiration) input, we show an increase in classification performance (AUROC) from 0.74 to 0.83 ($p<0.05$).

For many neurological conditions, this delay can result in increased morbidity and mortality.  An automated triaging tool could reduce reporting times for abnormal examinations by identifying abnormalities at the time of imaging and prioritizing the reporting of these scans.  In this work, we present a convolutional neural network (CNN) for detecting clinically-relevant  abnormalities  in T2-weighted  head  MRI scans. Using a validated neuroradiology report classifier, we generated a labelled dataset of 43,754 scans from two large UK hospitals for model training, and demonstrate accurate classification (area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) = 0.943) on a test set of 800 scans labelled by a team of neuroradiologists.  Importantly,  when trained on scans from only a single hospital the model generalized to scans from the other hospital (\u2206AUC\u22640.02).  A simulation study demonstrated that our model would reduce the mean reporting time for abnormal scans from 28 days to 14 days and from 9 days to 5 days at the two hospitals, demonstrating feasibility for use in a clinical triage environment.",

To address the ubiquitous mode collapse issue, recent works have strongly imposed certain characteristics such as Gaussianness to the prior by also explicitly mapping $\\mathcal{X}$ to $\\mathcal{Z}$ via encoder.

        "abstract": "Pathological brain appearances may be so heterogeneous as to be intelligible only as anomalies, defined by their deviation from normality rather than any specific pathological characteristic. Amongst the hardest tasks in medical imaging, detecting such anomalies requires models of the normal brain that combine compactness with the expressivity of the complex, long-range interactions that characterise its structural organisation. These are requirements transformers have arguably greater potential to satisfy than other current candidate architectures, but their application has been inhibited by their demands on data and computational resource. Here we combine the latent representation of vector quantised variational autoencoders with an ensemble of autoregressive transformers to enable unsupervised anomaly detection and segmentation defined by deviation from healthy brain imaging data, achievable at low computational cost, within relative modest data regimes. We compare our method to current state-of-the-art approaches across a series of experiments involving synthetic and real pathological lesions. On real lesions, we train our models on 15,000 radiologically normal participants from UK Biobank, and evaluate performance on four different brain MR datasets with small vessel disease, demyelinating lesions, and tumours. We demonstrate superior anomaly detection performance both image-wise and pixel-wise, achievable without post-processing. These results draw attention to the potential of transformers in this most challenging of imaging tasks.",

So far most highly accurate supervised approaches require dense manual annotations and complex multi-level architectures but may still be susceptible to label bias. We present a radically different approach for learning to estimate large deformations without expert supervision. Instead of regressing displacements, we train a 3D DeepLab network to predict automatic supervoxel segmentations. To enable consistent supervoxel labels, we use the warping field of a conventional approach and increase the accuracy by sampling multiple complementary over-segmentations. We experimentally demonstrate that 1) our deformable supervoxels are less sensitive to large initial misalignment and can combine linear and nonlinear registration and 2) using this self-supervised classification loss is more robust to noisy ground truth and leads to better convergence than direct regression as supervision.",

However, the performances of ConvNets are still limited by lacking the understanding of long-range spatial relations in an image. The recently proposed Vision Transformer (ViT) for image classification uses a purely self-attention-based model that learns long-range spatial relations to focus on the relevant parts of an image. Nevertheless, ViT emphasizes the low-resolution features because of the consecutive downsamplings, result in a lack of detailed localization information, making it unsuitable for image registration. Recently, several ViT-based image segmentation methods have been combined with ConvNets to improve the recovery of detailed localization information. Inspired by them, we present ViT-V-Net, which bridges ViT and ConvNet to provide volumetric medical image registration. The experimental results presented here demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves superior performance to several top-performing registration methods.",

To avoid the difficulty of choosing a metric for multimodal image registration, we propose a completely new concept relying on geometric instead of metric supervision with three-way registration cycles. Therefore, we create a synthetic image by applying a synthetic transformation on one of the input images. This leads to cycles that for each pair of input images comprise two multimodal transformations to be estimated and one known synthetic monomodal transformation. We minimise the discrepancy between the combined multimodal transformations and the synthetic monomodal transformation. By minimising this cycle discrepancy, we are able to learn multimodal registration between CT and MRI without metric supervision. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art metric supervision and comes very close to fully-supervised learning with ground truth labels. ",

The performance of this framework for various undersampling patterns has also been tested, and it has been observed that the framework is robust to deal with various sampling patterns - results in very high quality reconstruction (highest SSIM being 0.990$\\pm$0.006 for acceleration factor of 3.5), while being compared with the fully sampled reconstruction. It has been shown that the proposed framework can successfully reconstruct even for an acceleration factor of 20 for Cartesian (0.968$\\pm$0.005) and 17 for radially (0.962$\\pm$0.012) sampled data.

We compare two CNNs operating on two data representations, a conventional line integral data and raw photon counts, which have different quantitative properties and dynamic ranges.

        "abstract": "The contrast settings to select before acquiring magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal depend heavily on the subsequent tasks. As each contrast highlights different tissues, automated segmentation tools for example might be optimized for a certain contrast. While for radiotherapy, multiple scans of the same region with different contrasts can achieve a better accuracy for delineating tumours and organs at risk. Unfortunately, the optimal contrast for the subsequent automated methods might not be known during the time of signal acquisition, and performing multiple scans with different contrasts increases the total examination time and registering the sequences introduces extra work and potential errors. Building on the recent achievements of deep learning in medical applications, the presented work describes a novel approach for transferring any contrast to any other.\n\nThe novel model architecture incorporates the signal equation for spin echo sequences, and hence the model inherently learns the unknown quantitative maps for proton density, $T1$ and $T2$ relaxation times ($PD$, $T1$ and $T2$, respectively). This grants the model the ability to retrospectively reconstruct spin echo sequences by changing the contrast settings Echo and Repetition Time ($TE$ and $TR$, respectively). The model learns to identify the contrast of pelvic MR images, therefore no paired data of the same anatomy from different contrasts is required for training. This means that the experiments are easily reproducible with other contrasts or other patient anatomies.\n\nDespite the contrast of the input image, the model achieves accurate results for reconstructing signal with contrasts available for evaluation. For the same anatomy, the quantitative maps are consistent for a range of contrasts of input images. Realized in practice, the proposed method would greatly simplify the modern radiotherapy pipeline. The trained model is made public together with a tool for testing the model on example images.",

If the misplaced CVC remains undetected, it can lead to serious health consequences for the patient. Interpreting CXRs at a large scale in everyday clinical practice is time consuming and can create delays in the repositioning of the CVC. A computer-assisted assessment of post-procedure CXRs can help to prioritise cases and reduce human errors in stressful situations by objectifying decisions. However, final assessments must always be made by the clinicians, which is why the algorithmic support needs to be comprehensible.\nSince AI models are not yet able to detect catheter maplpositons with highest accuracy, the focus must be on efficient support in everyday clinical practice. In this work, we evaluate three different AI models, particularly with regard to the relationship between classification accuracy and the degree of explainability.

        "abstract": "In the last few years, deep learning classifiers have shown promising results in image-based medical diagnosis. However, interpreting the outputs of these models remains a challenge. In cancer diagnosis, interpretability can be achieved by localizing the region of the input image responsible for the output, i.e. the location of a lesion. Alternatively, segmentation or detection models can be trained with pixel-wise annotations indicating the locations of malignant lesions. Unfortunately, acquiring such labels is labor-intensive and requires medical expertise. To overcome this difficulty, weakly-supervised localization can be utilized. These methods allow neural network classifiers to output saliency maps highlighting the regions of the input most relevant to the classification task (e.g. malignant lesions in mammograms) using only image-level labels (e.g. whether the patient has cancer or not) during training. When applied to high-resolution images, existing methods produce low-resolution saliency maps. This is problematic in applications in which suspicious lesions are small in relation to the image size. In this work, we introduce a novel neural network architecture to perform weakly-supervised segmentation of high-resolution images. The proposed model selects regions of interest via coarse-level localization, and then performs fine-grained segmentation of those regions.\nWe apply this model to breast cancer diagnosis with screening mammography, and validate it on a large clinically-realistic dataset. Measured by Dice similarity score, our approach outperforms existing methods by a large margin in terms of localization performance of benign and malignant lesions, relatively improving the performance by 39.6% and 20.0%, respectively.

They denote a principled approach for detecting unseen types of anomalies without relying on large amounts of expensive ground truth annotations. To this end, deep generative models are trained exclusively on data from healthy patients and detect lesions as  Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data at test time (i.e. low likelihood). While this is a promising way of bypassing the need for costly annotations, this work demonstrates that it also renders this widely used unsupervised anomaly detection approach particularly vulnerable to non-lesion-based OOD data (e.g. data from different sensors). Since models are likely to be exposed to such OOD data in production, it is crucial to employ safety mechanisms to filter for such samples and run inference only on input for which the model is able to provide reliable results. We first show extensively that conventional, unsupervised anomaly detection mechanisms fail when being presented with true OOD data. Secondly, we apply prior knowledge to disentangle lesion-based OOD from their non-lesion-based counterparts.",

        "abstract": "To develop deep learning-based models for automatic analysis of histopathology whole slide images (WSIs), the atomic entities to be directly processed are often the smaller patches cropped from WSIs as it is not always possible to feed a whole WSI to a model given its enormous size. However, a trained model tends to relate the slide-specific characteristics to diagnosis results because a large number of patches cropped from the same WSI will  share common slide features and thus have strong correlations between them, resulting in deteriorated generalization capability of the trained model. Current approaches to alleviate this issue include data pre-processing (stain normalization or color augmentation) and adversarial learning, both of which introduce extra complications in computations. Alternatively, we propose to reduce the impact of this issue by introducing a new regularization term to the standard loss function to reduce the correlation of the patches from the same WSI. It is intuitive and easy-to-implement and introduces comparably smaller  computation overhead compared to existing approaches. Experimental results prove that the proposed regularization term is able to enhance the generalization capability of learning models and consequently to achieve better performance.

        "abstract": "Deep convolutional networks recently made many breakthroughs in medical image segmentation. Still, some anatomical artefacts may be observed in the segmentation results, with holes or inaccuracies near the object boundaries. To address these issues, loss functions that incorporate constraints, such as spatial information or prior knowledge, have been introduced. An example of such prior losses are the contour-based losses, which exploit distance maps to conduct point-by-point optimization between ground-truth and predicted contours. However, such losses may be computationally expensive or susceptible to trivial local solutions and vanishing gradient problems. Moreover, they depend on distance maps which tend to underestimate the contour-to-contour distances. We propose a novel loss constraint that optimizes the perimeter length of the segmented object relative to the ground-truth segmentation. The novelty lies in computing the perimeter with a soft approximation of the contour of the probability map via specialized non-trainable layers in the network. Moreover, we optimize the mean squared error between the predicted perimeter length and ground-truth perimeter length. This soft optimization of contour boundaries allows the network to take into consideration border irregularities within organs while still being efficient. Our experiments on three public datasets (spleen, hippocampus and cardiac structures) show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art boundary losses for both single and multi-organ segmentation.",

In this paper, we present a novel Bayesian approach to deep image prior using mean-field variational inference. This allows for uncertainty quantification on a per-pixel level and, given the right prior distribution on the network weights, omits the need for early stopping. We optimize the parameters of the weight prior towards reconstruction accuracy using Bayesian optimization with Gaussian Process regression. We evaluate our approach on different inverse tasks on a variety of modalities and demonstrate that an optimized weight prior outperforms former state-of-the-art Bayesian deep image prior approaches.

        "abstract": "Subject motion is one of the major challenges in clinical routine MR imaging. Despite ongoing research, motion correction has remained a complex problem without a universal solution. In advanced quantitative MR techniques, such as MR Fingerprinting, motion does not only affect a single image, like in single-contrast MRI, but disrupts the entire temporal evolution of the magnetization and causes parameter quantification errors due to a mismatch between the acquired and simulated signals. In this work, we present a deep learning-empowered retrospective motion correction for rapid 3D whole-brain multiparametric MRI based on Quantitative Transient-state Imaging (QTI). We propose a patch-based 3D multiscale convolutional neural network (CNN) that learns the residual error, i.e. after initial navigator-based correction, between motion-affected quantitative T1, T2 and proton density maps and their motion-free counterparts. For efficient model training despite limited data availability, we propose a physics-informed simulation to apply continuous motion-patterns to motion-free data. We evaluate the performance of the residual CNN on 1.5T and 3T MRI data of ten healthy volunteers. We analyze the generalizability of the model when applied to real clinical cases, including pediatric and adult patients with large brain lesions. Our study demonstrates that image quality can be significantly improved after correcting for subject motion. This has important implications in clinical setups where large amounts of motion affected data must be discarded.",

        "abstract": "There are many clinical contexts which require accurate detection and segmentation of all focal pathologies (e.g. lesions, tumours) in patient images. In cases where there are a mix of small and large lesions, standard binary cross entropy loss will result in better segmentation of large lesions at the expense of missing small ones. Adjusting the operating point to accurately detect all lesions generally leads to oversegmentation of large lesions. In this work, we propose a novel reweighing strategy to eliminate this performance gap, increasing small pathology detection performance while maintaining segmentation accuracy. We show that our reweighing strategy vastly outperforms competing strategies based on experiments on a large scale, multi-scanner, multi-center dataset of Multiple Sclerosis patient images.",

Here, we present a registration-based method for creating highly realistic and detailed anthropomorphic phantoms. The proposed registration method is built on the use of an unsupervised convolutional neural network (ConvNet) that warps the four-dimensional Xtended Cardiac-Torso (XCAT) phantom to a patient CT scan. The registration ConvNet iteratively optimizes an SSIM-based loss function for a given image pair without prior training.

An adaptation of the U-Net to output pixelwise regression values, instead of class labels, based on multichannel input data, has been developed in the remote sensing satellite imaging research domain. The pixelwise regression U-Net has only received limited consideration as a deep learning architecture in medical imaging for the image estimation/synthesis problem, and the limited work so far did not consider the application of 3D multichannel inputs. In this paper, we propose the use of the multichannel input pixelwise regression 3D U-Net (rUNet) for estimation of medical images. Our findings demonstrate that this approach is robust and versatile and can be applied to predicting a pending MRI examination of patients with Alzheimer's disease based on previous rounds of imaging, can perform medical image reconstruction (parametric mapping) in diffusion MRI, and can be applied to the estimation of one type of MRI examination from a collection of other types. Results demonstrate that the rUNet represents a single deep learning architecture capable of solving a variety of image estimation problems. Public domain code is provided.",

In this work, we propose an explainable image quality assessment system and validate our idea on foreign objects in a Chest X-Ray (Object-CXR) dataset. Our explainable pipeline relies on NormGrad, an algorithm, which can efficiently localize the image quality issues with saliency maps of the classifier. We compare our method with a range of saliency detection methods and illustrate the superior performance of NormGrad by obtaining a Pointing Game accuracy of 0.862 on the test dataset of the Object-CXR dataset.

The approach is either to fine-tune a pre-trained model or use it as a feature extractor.\nMost modern architecture contain batch normalisation layers, and fine-tuning a model with such layers requires taking a few precautions as they consist of trainable and non-trainable weights and have two operating modes: training and inference. Attention is primarily given to the non-trainable weights used during inference, as they are the primary source of unexpected behaviour or degradation in performance during transfer learning. It is typically recommended to fine-tune the model with the batch normalisation layers kept in inference mode during both training and inference. \nIn this paper, we pay closer attention instead to the trainable weights of the batch normalisation layers, and we explore their expressive influence in the context of transfer learning.\nWe find that only fine-tuning the trainable weights (scale and centre) of the batch normalisation layers leads to similar performance as to fine-tuning all of the weights, with the added benefit of faster convergence. We demonstrate this on a variety of seven publicly available medical imaging datasets, using four different model architectures. ",

        "abstract": "Digital pathology has enabled us to capture, store and analyze scanned biopsy samples as digital images. Recent advances in deep learning are contributing to computational pathology to improve diagnosis and treatment. However, considering challenges inherent to whole slide images (WSIs), it is not easy to employ deep learning in digital pathology. More importantly, computational bottlenecks induced by the gigapixel WSIs make it difficult to use deep learning for end-to-end image representation. To mitigate this challenge, many patch-based approaches have been proposed. Although patching WSIs enables us to use deep learning, we end up with a bag of patches or set representation which makes downstream tasks non-trivial. More importantly, considering set representation per WSI, it is not clear how one can obtain similarity between two WSIs (sets) for tasks like image search matching. To address this challenge, we propose a neural network based on Convolutions Neural Network (CNN) and Deep Sets to learn one permutation invariant vector representation per WSI in an end-to-end manner. Considering available labels at the WSI level - namely, primary site and cancer subtypes - we train the proposed network in a multi-label setting to encode both primary site and diagnosis. Having in mind that every primary site has its own specific cancer subtypes, we propose to use the predicted label for the primary site to recognize the cancer subtype. The proposed architecture is used for transfer learning of WSIs and validated two different tasks, i.e., search and classification. The results show that the proposed architecture can be used to obtain WSI representations that achieve better performance both in terms of retrieval performance and search time against \\emph{Yottixel}, a recently developed search engine for pathology images. Further, the model achieved competitive performance against the state-of-art in lung cancer classification.\n",

Due to the large search space, this is cumbersome and often leads to sub-optimal generalization performance. In this work, we focus on automated and computationally efficient data augmentation policy selection for histopathological slides.

We test these modifications on H\\&E-stained histopathology slides from Camelyon17 dataset.

        "abstract": "Motivation: Traditional image attribution methods struggle to satisfactorily explain predictions of neural networks. Prediction explanation is important, especially in medical imaging, for avoiding the unintended consequences of deploying AI systems when false positive predictions can impact patient care. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop improved models for model explainability and introspection. \nSpecific problem: A new approach is to transform input images to increase or decrease features which cause the prediction. However, current approaches are difficult to implement as they are monolithic or rely on GANs. These hurdles prevent wide adoption.\nOur approach: Given an arbitrary classifier, we propose a simple autoencoder and gradient update (Latent Shift) that can transform the latent representation of a specific input image to exaggerate or curtail the features used for prediction. We use this method to study chest X-ray classifiers and evaluate their performance. We conduct a reader study with two radiologists assessing 240 chest X-ray predictions to identify which ones are false positives (half are) using traditional attribution maps or our proposed method.\nResults: We found low overlap with ground truth pathology masks for models with reasonably high accuracy. However, the results from our reader study indicate that these models are generally looking at the correct features.\nWe also found that the Latent Shift explanation allows a user to have more confidence in true positive predictions compared to traditional approaches (0.15\u00b10.95 in a 5 point scale with p=0.01) with only a small increase in false positive predictions (0.04\u00b11.06 with p=0.57).\n\nAccompanying webpage: https://mlmed.org/gifsplanation/\nSource code: https://github.com/mlmed/gifsplanation",

Hypothesizing that the scanner device plays a decisive role in this effect, we evaluated the susceptibility of a standard mitosis detection approach to the domain shift introduced by using a different whole slide scanner. Our work is based on the MICCAI-MIDOG challenge 2021 data set, which includes 200 tumor cases of human breast cancer and four scanners.  \n\nOur work indicates that the domain shift induced not by biochemical variability but purely by the choice of acquisition device is underestimated so far. Models trained on images of the same scanner yielded an average F1 score of 0.683, while models trained on a single other scanner only yielded an average F1 score of 0.325.

        "abstract": "Segmentation of enhancing tumours or lesions from MRI is important for detecting new disease activity in many clinical contexts. However, accurate segmentation requires the inclusion of medical images (e.g., T1 post-contrast MRI) acquired after injecting patients with a contrast agent (e.g., Gadolinium), a process no longer thought to be safe. Although a number of modality-agnostic segmentation networks have been developed over the past few years, they have been met with limited success in the context of enhancing pathology segmentation. In this work, we present HAD-Net, a novel offline adversarial knowledge distillation (KD) technique, whereby a pre-trained teacher segmentation network, with access to all MRI sequences, teaches a student network, via hierarchical adversarial training, to better overcome the large domain shift presented when crucial images are absent during inference. In particular, we apply HAD-Net to the challenging task of enhancing tumour segmentation when access to post-contrast imaging is not available. The proposed network is trained and tested on the BraTS 2019 brain tumour segmentation challenge dataset, where it achieves performance improvements in the ranges of 16% - 26% over (a) recent modality-agnostic segmentation methods (U-HeMIS, U-HVED), (b) KD-Net adapted to this problem, (c) the pre-trained student network and (d) a non-hierarchical version of the network (AD-Net), in terms of Dice scores for enhancing tumour (ET). The network also shows improvements in tumour core (TC) Dice scores. Finally, the network outperforms both the baseline student network and AD-Net in terms of uncertainty quantification for enhancing tumour segmentation based on the BraTS 2019 uncertainty challenge metrics.

        "abstract": "While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained by back-propagation have seen unprecedented success at semantic  segmentation tasks, they are known to struggle on out-of-distribution data. Markov random fields (MRFs) on the other hand, encode simpler distributions over labels that, although less flexible than UNets, are less prone to over-fitting. In this paper, we propose to fuse both strategies by computing the product of distributions of a UNet and an MRF. As this product is intractable, we solve for an approximate distribution using an iterative mean-field approach. The resulting MRF-UNet is trained jointly by back-propagation. Compared to other works using conditional random fields (CRFs), the MRF has no dependency on the imaging data, which should allow for less over-fitting. We show on 3D neuroimaging data that this novel network improves generalisation to out-of-distribution samples. Furthermore, it allows the overall number of parameters to be reduced while preserving high accuracy. These results suggest that a classic MRF smoothness prior can allow for less over-fitting when principally integrated into a CNN model.

While supervised machine learning has already been applied successfully, the vast amount of unlabelled data offers new opportunities for un- and self-supervised learning methods. Especially with regard to the multimodal nature of most clinical data, the labelling of multiple data types becomes quickly infeasible in the medical domain. However, to the best of our knowledge, multimodal unsupervised methods have been tested extensively on toy-datasets only but have never been applied to real-world medical data, for direct applications such as disease classification and image generation.

It is potentially usable for tracking without using fiducials. For this, a method for learning meaningful representations with which recognizing anatomical structures in different time frames is capable would be useful. In this study, 3DUS patches are reduced into a 128-dimensional representation space using conventional autoencoder, variational autoencoder and sliced-wasserstein autoencoder. In the representation space, the capability of separating different ultrasound patches as well as recognizing similar patches is investigated and compared based on a dataset of liver images. Two metrics to evaluate the tracking capability in the representation space are proposed. It is shown that ultrasound patches with different anatomical structures can be distinguished and sets of similar patches can be clustered in representation space. The results indicate that the investigated autoencoders have different levels of usability for target tracking in 3DUS.",

This estimation is also called pseudo healthy synthesis. One example application is the personalization of aortic root prostheses during valve-sparing aortic root surgery. Even though several methods for pseudohealthy synthesis were proposed during the last years, it might not always be necessary to taylor a completely individual and unique prosthesis for each and every patient as this introduces high costs and regulatory issues. Another option is to identify a set of prosthesis types that represents all natural healthy shapes in an adequate way. Then, the pseudohealthy synthesis problem becomes a classification problem, aiming on predicting the optimal prosthesis out of the set of candidates given a pathological shape.\nIn this work, we present a fully automized workflow of unsupervised shape typification and type classification based on pathological data for the example of personalizing aortic root prostheses shapes. We provide a proof-of-concept study on an ex-vivo porcine data set, including a thorough evaluation of the model's hyperparameters and the number of identified shape types.

        "abstract": "Ensuring the privacy of research participants is vital, even more so in healthcare environments. Deep learning approaches to neuroimaging require large datasets, and this often necessitates sharing data between multiple sites, which is antithetical to the privacy objectives. Federated learning is a commonly proposed solution to this problem. It circumvents the need for data sharing by sharing parameters during the training process. However, we demonstrate that allowing access to parameters may leak private information even if data is never directly shared. In particular, we show that it is possible to infer if a sample was used to train the model given only access to the model prediction (black-box) or access to the model itself (white-box) and some leaked samples from the training data distribution. Such attacks are commonly referred to as \\textit{Membership Inference attacks}. We show realistic Membership Inference attacks on deep learning models trained for 3D neuroimaging tasks in a centralized as well as decentralized setup. We demonstrate feasible attacks on brain age prediction models (deep learning models that predict a person's age from their brain MRI scan). We correctly identified whether an MRI scan was used in model training with a 60% to over 80% success rate depending on model complexity and security assumptions.",

Both models are based on the deformable template paradigm, however they show different weaknesses for the representation of medical images. Diffeomorphic autoencoders only consider spatial deformations, whereas deforming autoencoders also  regard changes in the appearance, however no uniform template is generated for the whole training dataset, and the appearance is modeled depending on a very few parameters. In this work, we propose a method that represents images based on a global template, where next to the  spatial displacement, the appearance is modeled as the pixel-wise intensity difference to the unified template. To however ensure that the generated appearance offsets adhere to the template shape,  a guided filter smoothing of the appearance map is integrated into an end-to-end training process. This regularization significantly improves the disentanglement of shape and appearance and thus enables multi-modal image modeling. Furthermore, the generated templates are crisper and the registration accuracy improves. Our experiments also show applications of the proposed approach in the field of automatic population analysis.

Yet due to variabilities in the CMR acquisition process, images from different centers or acquisition protocols differ considerably. This causes deep learning models to fail silently. It is therefore crucial to identify out-of-distribution (OOD) samples for which the trained model is unsuitable. For models with a self-supervised proxy task, we propose a simple method to identify OOD samples that does not require adapting the model architecture or access to a separate OOD dataset during training. As the performance of self-supervised tasks can be assessed without ground truth information, it indicates during test time when a sample differs from the training distribution. The proposed method combines a voxel-wise uncertainty estimate with the self-supervision information. Our approach is validated across three CMR datasets and two different proxy tasks. We find that it is more effective at detecting OOD samples than state-of-the-art post-hoc OOD detection and uncertainty estimation approaches.",

Segmentation models based on the U-net architecture are trained on each of these resulting folds yielding the candidate models for our deep ensemble model which are aggregated to obtain the final prediction. The proposed deep ensemble model is compared to relevant baselines, in their ability to segment interneurons in microscopic images of mice spinal cord, showing improved performance on an independent test set.",

        "abstract": "The excessive deposition of misfolded proteins such as amyloid-$\\beta$~(A$\\beta$) protein is an aging event underlying several neurodegenerative diseases. Mounting evidence shows that the spreading of neuropathological burden has a strong association to the white matter tracts in the brain which can be measured using diffusion-weighted imaging and tractography technologies. Most of the previous studies analyze the dynamic progression of amyloid using cross-sectional data which is not robust to the heterogeneous A$\\beta$ dynamics across the population. In this regard, we propose a graph neural network-based learning framework to capture the disease-related dynamics by tracking the spreading of amyloid across brain networks from the subject-specific longitudinal PET images. To learn from limited (2 \u2013 3 timestamps) and noisy longitudinal data, we restrict the space of amyloid propagation patterns to a latent heat diffusion model which is constrained by the anatomical connectivity of the brain. Our experiments show that restricting the dynamics to be a heat diffusion mechanism helps to train a robust deep neural network for predicting future time points and classifying Alzheimer's disease brain.",

        "abstract": "Using intracoronary imaging modalities like intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) has a positive impact on the results of percutaneous coronary interventions. Efficient extraction of important vessel metrics like lumen diameter, vessel wall thickness or plaque burden via automatic segmentation of IVUS images can improve the clinical workflow. State-of-the-art segmentation results are usually achieved by data-driven methods like convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, clinical data sets are often rather small leading to extraction of image features which are not very meaningful and thus decreasing performance. This is also the case for some applications which inherently allow for only small amounts of available data, e.g., detection of diseases with extremely small prevalence or online-adaptation of an existing algorithm to individual patients.\n\nIn this work we investigate how integrating scattering transformations - as special forms of wavelet transformations - into CNNs could improve the extraction of meaningful features. To this end, we developed a novel network module which uses features of a scattering transform for an attention mechanism.\n\nWe observed that this approach improves the results of calcium segmentation up to 8.2 % (relatively) in terms of the Dice coefficient and 24.8 % in terms of the modified Hausdorff distance. In the case of lumen and vessel wall segmentation, the improvements are up to 2.3 % (relatively) in terms of the Dice coefficient and 30.8 % in terms of the modified Hausdorff distance.\n\nIncorporating scattering transformations as a component of an attention block into CNNs improves the segmentation results on small IVUS segmentation data sets. In general, scattering transformations can help in situations where efficient feature extractors can not be learned via the training data. This makes our attention module an interesting candidate for applications like few-shot learning for patient adaptation or detection of rare diseases.",

Due to the lesions' heterogeneous nature, it is difficult for machine learning models to capture the corresponding variability.

We evaluate our approach specifically on liver lesion segmentation and more generally on lesion segmentation in computed tomography (CT), as well as segmentation of skin lesions from dermatoscopic images. We show that the proposed joint training improves the quality of the lesion segmentation by 4% percent according to the Dice coefficient and 6% according to averaged Hausdorff distance (AVD), while reducing the training time required by up to 75%. \n",

Cine-MRI of the abdomen is a non-invasive imaging technique allowing evaluation of this motility. While 2D cine-MR imaging is increasingly used for this purpose in both clinical practice and in research settings, the potential of 3D cine-MR imaging has been largely underexplored. In the absence of image analysis tools enabling investigation of the intestines as 3D structures, the assessment of motility in 3D cine-images is generally limited to the evaluation of movement in separate 2D slices. Hence, to obtain an untangled representation of the small intestine in 3D cine-MRI, we propose a method to extract a centerline of the intestine, thereby allowing easier (visual) assessment by human observers, as well as providing a possible starting point for automatic analysis methods quantifying peristaltic bowel movement along intestinal segments. The proposed method automatically tracks individual sections of the small intestine in 3D space, using a stochastic tracker built on top of a CNN-based orientation classifier. We show that the proposed method outperforms a non-stochastic iterative tracking approach.",

Recently, several supervised deep learning (DL) techniques have demonstrated impressive performance in solving the challenging ill-posed field-to-source inverse QSM reconstruction problem. To address the lack of the inherent non-existent ground-truth QSM references, a model-based method was recently proposed using the well-established physical model. However, it fails to perform well at the regions with large susceptibility variations. Here, we proposed uQSM+ with data augmentation techniques to improve the model-based learning. The proposed method was evaluated on a multi-orientation QSM datasets and 2019 QSM reconstruction challenge datasets. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation showed that uQSM+ and zero-shot uQSM+ was capable of reconstructing high quality QSM.

This could potentially be alleviated through directly predicting Ki67 scores from routine hematoxylin and eosin (H\\&E) stained whole-slide-images (WSIs). We compared four different deep learning based approaches to  predict Ki67 scores from routine H\\&E stained WSIs in a dataset that consists of matched H\\&E and Ki67 WSIs from 126 breast cancer patients, resulting in a Spearman correlation between WSI cancer ROI averages of 0.546 for the best performing model in a 5-fold cross-validation (CV).

The proposed model consists of three main parts:\n1) The parallel graph similarity branch and content branch, where the graph similarity branch aims at exploiting the similarity and symmetry across different image sub-regions in low-resolution feature space and provides additional priors for the content branch to enhance texture details.\n2) A feedback mechanism with a recurrent structure to refine low-level representations with high-level information and generate powerful high-level texture details by handling the feedback connections. \n3) A reconstruction to remove the artifacts and recover super-resolution images by using the estimated sub-region self-similarity priors obtained from the graph similarity branch. We evaluate our method on two image enhancement tasks: i) cross-protocol super resolution of diffusion MRI; ii) artifact removal of FLAIR MR images.

Biological brain age estimation from MRI scans is a common way to quantify this effect whereas differences between biological and chronological age indicate degenerative processes. The ability to visualize and analyze the morphological age-related changes in the image space directly is essential to improve the understanding of brain aging. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning based approach to unify biological brain age estimation and age-conditioned template creation in a single, consistent model. We achieve this by developing a deterministic autoencoder that successfully disentangles age-related morphological changes and subject-specific variations. This allows its use as a brain age regressor as well as a generative brain aging model. The proposed approach demonstrates accurate biological brain age prediction, and realistic generation of age-conditioned brain templates and simulated age-specific brain images when applied to a database of more than 2000 subjects.\n",

Our approach advances the existing active learning methods in three aspects. Firstly, we improve the classification performance with fewer manual annotations by presenting a sample selection strategy called gist set selection. Secondly, unlike traditional methods focusing only on random uncertain samples of low prediction confidence, we propose a new method in which only informative uncertain samples are selected for human annotation. Thirdly, we propose an application of online learning where high-confidence samples are automatically selected, iteratively assigned, and pseudo-labels are updated. We validated our approach on two private and one public dataset. The experimental results show that, by applying GOAL, we can reduce required labeled data up to 88% while maintaining the same F1 scores compared to the models trained on full datasets",

Firstly, a well-performing survival model has minimal clinical application if it does not contribute to the stratification of a cancer patient cohort into different risk groups, preferably driven by histologic morphologies. In the clinical setting, individuals are not given specific prognostic predictions, but are rather predicted to lie within a risk group which has a general survival trend. Thus, It is imperative that a survival model produces well-stratified risk groups. Secondly, until now, survival modelling was done in a two-stage approach (encoding and aggregation). EPIC-Survival bridges encoding and aggregation into an end-to-end survival modelling approach, while introducing stratification boosting to encourage the model to not only optimize ranking, but also to discriminate between risk groups. In this study we show that EPIC-Survival performs better than other approaches in modelling intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), a historically difficult cancer to model. We found that stratification boosting further improves model performance and helps identify specific histologic differences, not commonly sought out in ICC.",
