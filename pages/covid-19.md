# MIDL FAQ on the Covid-19 pandemic

The Covid-19 pandemic is ongoing and its dynamic makes long-term planning very difficult. We, and the German authorities, are monitoring the situation closely, and will take any measure required to protect everyone's health and safety. MIDL 2021 is most likely to take place as an hybrid (local+virtual) event and **all accepted papers will be published and all authors will be able to present their work (in person or virtually)**.

We will keep the MIDL community updated via Twitter and Mail and for any upcoming questions, the organizers can be reached at [2021@midl.io](mailto:2021@midl.io). In addition, frequently asked questions about the issue and its impact on MIDL will be answered on this page.


## Is MIDL 2021 canceled ?
No! MIDL 2021 in LÃ¼beck is planned as a hybrid (local+virtual) event and will take place in any case.

## I have an accepted paper. How will I present it?
We are currently developing solutions so that MIDL can mostly take place online, in an interactive way.

Authors of accepted papers will receive detailed instructions in the coming weeks, but they can already expect to record their oral presentation.

## Will the event be streamed ?
Yes, [as in the previous years](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd87UPUTt-oqTeGi8fQw-_w). The technical details are not finalized yet, but anyone will be able to watch the talks for free, from anywhere.

We are also developing remote participation options. Many other events have been impacted and we expect to learn from their experience.


## Are challenges canceled ?
No. They will be 100% online.
