        abstract='The growing demand for head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations, along with a global shortage of radiologists, has led to an increase in the time taken to report head MRI scans around the world.  For many neurological conditions, this delay can result in increased morbidity and mortality.  An automated triaging tool could reduce reporting times for abnormal examinations by identifying abnormalities at the time of imaging and prioritizing the reporting of these scans.  In this work, we present a convolutional neural network (CNN) for detecting clinically-relevant  abnormalities  in T2-weighted  head  MRI scans. Using a validated neuroradiology report classifier, we generated a labelled dataset of 43,754 scans from two large UK hospitals for model training, and demonstrate accurate classification (area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) = 0.943) on a test set of 800 scans labelled by a team of neuroradiologists.  Importantly,  when trained on scans from only a single hospital the model generalized to scans from the other hospital (∆AUC≤0.02).  A simulation study demonstrated that our model would reduce the mean reporting time for abnormal scans from 28 days to 14 days and from 9 days to 5 days at the two hospitals, demonstrating feasibility for use in a clinical triage environment.')

        abstract='In this paper, we propose a novel approach to overcome the problem of imbalanced datasets for object detection tasks, when the distribution is not uniform over all classes. The general idea is to compute a probability vector, encoding the probability for each image to be fed to the network during the training phase. This probability vector is computed by solving some quadratic optimization problem and ensures that all classes are seen with similar frequency. We apply this method to a fetal anatomies detection problem, and conduct a thorough statistical analysis of the resulting performance to show that it performs significantly better than two baseline models: one with images sampled uniformly and one implementing classical oversampling.')

{{ paper('Unsupervised Brain Anomaly Detection and Segmentation with Transformers',
        'Walter Hugo Lopez Pinaya, Petru-Daniel Tudosiu, Robert Gray, Geraint Rees, Parashkev Nachev, Sébastien Ourselin, M. Jorge Cardoso',
        openreview='https://openreview.net/forum?id=Z1tlNqbCpp_',

        proceedings='',
        abstract='Pathological brain appearances may be so heterogeneous as to be intelligible only as anomalies, defined by their deviation from normality rather than any specific pathological characteristic. Amongst the hardest tasks in medical imaging, detecting such anomalies requires models of the normal brain that combine compactness with the expressivity of the complex, long-range interactions that characterise its structural organisation. These are requirements transformers have arguably greater potential to satisfy than other current candidate architectures, but their application has been inhibited by their demands on data and computational resource. Here we combine the latent representation of vector quantised variational autoencoders with an ensemble of autoregressive transformers to enable unsupervised anomaly detection and segmentation defined by deviation from healthy brain imaging data, achievable at low computational cost, within relative modest data regimes. We compare our method to current state-of-the-art approaches across a series of experiments involving synthetic and real pathological lesions. On real lesions, we train our models on 15,000 radiologically normal participants from UK Biobank, and evaluate performance on four different brain MR datasets with small vessel disease, demyelinating lesions, and tumours. We demonstrate superior anomaly detection performance both image-wise and pixel-wise, achievable without post-processing. These results draw attention to the potential of transformers in this most challenging of imaging tasks.')
