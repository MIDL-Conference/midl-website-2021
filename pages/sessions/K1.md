        abstract="Noisy data present in medical imaging datasets can often aid the development of robust models that are equipped to handle real-world data. However, if the bad data contains insufficient anatomical information, it can have a severe negative effect on the model\\'s performance. We propose a novel methodology using a semi-supervised Siamese network to identify bad data. This method requires only a small pool of \\'reference\\' medical images to be reviewed by a non-expert human to ensure the major anatomical structures are present in the Field of View. The model trains on this reference set and identifies bad data by using the Siamese network to compute the distance between the reference set and all other medical images in the dataset. This methodology achieves an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.989 for identifying bad data. Code will be available at https://git.io/JYFuV.")

        abstract='Unbalanced data poses a challenge when training machine learning algorithms; the algorithm often overfits on the dominant class and neglects the smaller classes. While methods such as oversampling aim to rebalance the data, this can lead to overfitting. When a certain class is underrepresented, either because it a rare disease or few images exist then methods are needed which can adequately account for this. The generalized extreme value (GEV) activation has recently been proposed as a solution to highly unbalanced data; however, the GEV activation is only available for binary classification. We extend this to the multiclass case with the multiclass GEV (mGEV) activation. We conduct experiments on X-ray images, with three classes, showing much-improved performance over the commonly used softmax activation. Code for the mGEV activation is available at [https://github.com/JTBridge/GEV].')

We introduce a 3D recurrent and fully convolutional neural network architecture to produce high-precision Monte-Carlo-like dose simulations from low-precision and cheap-to-compute ones. We use the noise-to-noise setting, a weakly supervised training strategy, by training the models solely on low-precision data without expensive-to-compute, high-precision dose simulations. Several evaluation metrics are used to compare with other methods and to assess the clinical viability and quality of the generated dose maps.')

        abstract='Obtaining large amounts of high quality labeled microscopy data is expensive and time-consuming. To overcome this issue, we propose a deep ensemble model which aims to utilise limited labeled training data. We train multiple identical Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) segmentation models on training data that is partitioned into folds in two steps. First, the data is split based on sample diversity or expert knowledge reflecting the possible {\\em modes} of the underlying data distribution. In the second step, these partitions are split into random folds like in a cross-validation setting. Segmentation models based on the U-net architecture are trained on each of these resulting folds yielding the candidate models for our deep ensemble model which are aggregated to obtain the final prediction. The proposed deep ensemble model is compared to relevant baselines, in their ability to segment interneurons in microscopic images of mice spinal cord, showing improved performance on an independent test set.')

        abstract="The excessive deposition of misfolded proteins such as amyloid-β~(Aβ) protein is an aging event underlying several neurodegenerative diseases. Mounting evidence shows that the spreading of neuropathological burden has a strong association to the white matter tracts in the brain which can be measured using diffusion-weighted imaging and tractography technologies. Most of the previous studies analyze the dynamic progression of amyloid using cross-sectional data which is not robust to the heterogeneous Aβ dynamics across the population. In this regard, we propose a graph neural network-based learning framework to capture the disease-related dynamics by tracking the spreading of amyloid across brain networks from the subject-specific longitudinal PET images. To learn from limited (2 – 3 timestamps) and noisy longitudinal data, we restrict the space of amyloid propagation patterns to a latent heat diffusion model which is constrained by the anatomical connectivity of the brain. Our experiments show that restricting the dynamics to be a heat diffusion mechanism helps to train a robust deep neural network for predicting future time points and classifying Alzheimer\\'s disease brain.")

        abstract='Using intracoronary imaging modalities like intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) has a positive impact on the results of percutaneous coronary interventions. Efficient extraction of important vessel metrics like lumen diameter, vessel wall thickness or plaque burden via automatic segmentation of IVUS images can improve the clinical workflow. State-of-the-art segmentation results are usually achieved by data-driven methods like convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, clinical data sets are often rather small leading to extraction of image features which are not very meaningful and thus decreasing performance. This is also the case for some applications which inherently allow for only small amounts of available data, e.g., detection of diseases with extremely small prevalence or online-adaptation of an existing algorithm to individual patients.In this work we investigate how integrating scattering transformations - as special forms of wavelet transformations - into CNNs could improve the extraction of meaningful features. To this end, we developed a novel network module which uses features of a scattering transform for an attention mechanism.We observed that this approach improves the results of calcium segmentation up to 8.2 % (relatively) in terms of the Dice coefficient and 24.8 % in terms of the modified Hausdorff distance. In the case of lumen and vessel wall segmentation, the improvements are up to 2.3 % (relatively) in terms of the Dice coefficient and 30.8 % in terms of the modified Hausdorff distance.Incorporating scattering transformations as a component of an attention block into CNNs improves the segmentation results on small IVUS segmentation data sets. In general, scattering transformations can help in situations where efficient feature extractors can not be learned via the training data. This makes our attention module an interesting candidate for applications like few-shot learning for patient adaptation or detection of rare diseases.')

        abstract='In classification, categories are typically treated as independent of one-another. In many problems, however, this neglects the natural relations that exist between categories, which are often dictated by an underlying biological or physical process. In this work, we propose novel formulations of the classification problem, aimed at reintroducing class relations into the training process. We demonstrate the benefit of these approaches for the classification of intravenous contrast enhancement phase in CT images, an important task in the medical imaging domain. First, we propose manual ways reintroduce knowledge about problem-specific interclass relations into the training process. Second, we propose a general approach to jointly learn categorical label representations that can implicitly encode natural interclass relations, alleviating the need for strong prior assumptions or knowledge. We show that these improvements are most significant for smaller training sets, typical in the medical imaging domain where access to large amounts of labelled data is often not trivial.')

        abstract="We introduce the concept of multi-task learning to weakly-supervised lesion segmentation, one of the most critical and challenging tasks in medical imaging. Due to the lesions\\' heterogeneous nature, it is difficult for machine learning models to capture the corresponding variability. We propose to jointly train a lesion segmentation model and a lesion classifier in a multi-task learning fashion, where the supervision of the latter is obtained by clustering the RECIST measurements of the lesions. We evaluate our approach specifically on liver lesion segmentation and more generally on lesion segmentation in computed tomography (CT), as well as segmentation of skin lesions from dermatoscopic images. We show that the proposed joint training improves the quality of the lesion segmentation by 4% percent according to the Dice coefficient and 6% according to averaged Hausdorff distance (AVD), while reducing the training time required by up to 75%.")
