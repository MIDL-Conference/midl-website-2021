We tailor its loss function to the challenges of multi-class segmentation and equip it with an additional false positive loss term. We evaluate it on the assessment of tumor and immune cells in PD-L1 stained lung cancer histopathology images, and compare it with YOLOv5.')

        abstract='One of the most important challenges for computer-aided analysis in digital pathology is the development of robust deep neural networks, which can cope with variations in color and resolution of digitized whole-slide images (WSIs). It has been shown that color augmentation during training is a useful method to aid a model generalize better to heterogeneous data. In this work, we compare state of the art models EfficientNet, Xception, Inception, ResNet, DenseNet, MobileNet and QuickNet on a multi-scanner database comprising slides each digitized with six different scanners. All of the networks are trained with data of only one scanner applying a combination of color and blur augmentation techniques. All models show similar tendencies across the different scanner databases but differ in the overall classification accuracy. Differences in training and inference time, however, are more pronounced: on a mid-range GPU, the inference time of the fastest model (QuickNet) is 13 times faster than the slowest one (EfficientNet B4). There is also a trade-off between speed and accuracy, the slower networks are more stable across different scanners and show the overall best performance. A good compromise between quality and inference time is achieved by EfficientNet B0.')

        abstract='Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the main approach for training deep networks: it moves towards the optimum of the cost function by  iteratively updating the parameters of a model in the direction of the gradient of the loss evaluated on a minibatch. Several variants of SGD have been proposed to make adaptive step sizes for each parameter (adaptive gradient) and take into account the previous updates (momentum). Among several alternative of SGD the most popular are AdaGrad, AdaDelta, RMSProp and Adam which scale coordinates of the gradient by square roots of some form of averaging of the squared coordinates in the past gradients and automatically adjust the learning rate on a parameter basis. In this work, we compare Adam based variants based on the difference between the present and the past gradients, the step size is adjusted for each parameter. We run several tests benchmarking proposed methods using medical image data. The experiments are performed using ResNet50 architecture neural network. Moreover, we have tested ensemble of networks and the fusion with ResNet50 trained with stochastic gradient descent. To combine the set of ResNet50 the simple sum rule has been applied. Proposed ensemble obtains very high performance, it obtains accuracy comparable or better than actual state of the art. To improve reproducibility and research efficiency the MATLAB source code used for this research is available at GitHub: https://github.com/LorisNanni.')

Despite this, there has been limited research into how the diversity of source data used for SSL tasks impacts performance. The current study quantifies changes to downstream classification of metastatic tissue in lymph node sections of the PatchCamelyon dataset when datasets from different domains (natural images, textures, histology) are used for SSL pre-training. We show that for cases with limited training data, using diverse datasets from different domains for SSL pre-training can achieve comparable performance when compared with SSL pre-training on the target dataset.')

        abstract='Diagnosis of cancer often relies on the time-consuming examination of histopathology slides by expert pathologists. Automation via supervised deep learning methods require large amounts of pixel-wise annotated data that is costly to acquire. Unsupervised density estimation methods that rely only on the availability of healthy examples could cut down the cost of annotation. We propose to use residual flows as density estimator and compare different tests for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. Our results suggest that unsupervised OOD detection is a viable approach for detecting suspicious regions in histopathology slides.')

However, the high-resolution multiplexed images are often only available for a subset of regions of interest (RoIs), clinical data is not easily accessible and the datasets are generally too small to apply off-the-shelf deep learning methods commonly used in histopathology. In this paper, we focus on datasets with few images and without labels, and aim to learn representations for slides. We choose a task of patient identification that leads our new model to select RoIs with discriminative properties and infer patient-specific features that can be used later for any task via transfer learning. The experimental results on the synthetic data generated by taking the tumor microenvironment into account indicate that the proposed method is a promising step towards computer-aided analysis in unlabeled datasets of high-resolution images.')

Manual control and supervision of these gigapixel images are labor-intensive.  Therefore, we report the first multi-class deep learning model trained on whole-slide images covering multiple tissue and stain types for semantic segmentation of artifacts.  Our approach reaches a Dice score of 0.91, on average, across six artifact types, and outperforms the competition on external test set.

        abstract="In recent years, the availability of digitized Whole Slide Images (WSIs) has enabled the use of deep learning-based computer vision techniques for automated disease diagnosis. However, WSIs present unique computational and algorithmic challenges. WSIs are gigapixel-sized (approx. 100K pixels), making them infeasible to be used directly for training deep neural networks. Also, often only slide-level labels are available for training as detailed annotations are tedious and can be time-consuming for experts. Approaches using multiple-instance learning (MIL) frameworks have been shown to overcome these challenges. Current state-of-the-art approaches divide the learning framework into two decoupled parts: a convolutional neural network (CNN) for encoding the patches followed by an independent aggregation approach for slide-level prediction. In this approach, the aggregation step has no bearing on the representations learned by the CNN encoder. We have proposed an end-to-end framework that clusters the patches from a WSI into k-groups, samples k\\' patches from each group for training, and uses an adaptive attention mechanism for slide level prediction; Cluster-to-Conquer (C2C). We have demonstrated that dividing a WSI into clusters can improve the model training by exposing it to diverse discriminative features extracted from the patches. We regularized the clustering mechanism by introducing a KL-divergence loss between the attention weights of patches in a cluster and the uniform distribution. The framework is optimized end-to-end on slide-level cross-entropy, patch-level cross-entropy, and KL-divergence loss.")
