        abstract='Machine Learning has become more and more popular in the medical domain over the past years. While supervised machine learning has already been applied successfully, the vast amount of unlabelled data offers new opportunities for un- and self-supervised learning methods. Especially with regard to the multimodal nature of most clinical data, the labelling of multiple data types becomes quickly infeasible in the medical domain. However, to the best of our knowledge, multimodal unsupervised methods have been tested extensively on toy-datasets only but have never been applied to real-world medical data, for direct applications such as disease classification and image generation. In this article, we demonstrate that self-supervised methods provide promising results on medical data while highlighting that the task is extremely challenging and that there is space for substantial improvements.')

        abstract='Spatiotemporal graphs are a natural representation of dynamic brain activity derived from functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) data. Previous works, however, tend to ignore time dynamics of the brain and focus on static graphs. In this paper, we propose a temporal graph deep generative model (TG-DGM) which clusters brain regions into communities that evolve over time. In particular, subject embeddings capture inter-subject variability and its impact on communities using neural networks. We validate our model on the UK Biobank data. Results of up to 0.81 AUC ROC on the task of biological sex classification demonstrate that injecting time dynamics in our model outperforms a static baseline.')

        abstract='3D ultrasound (3DUS) becomes more interesting for target tracking in radiation therapy due to its capability to provide volumetric images in real-time without using ionizing radiation. It is potentially usable for tracking without using fiducials. For this, a method for learning meaningful representations with which recognizing anatomical structures in different time frames is capable would be useful. In this study, 3DUS patches are reduced into a 128-dimensional representation space using conventional autoencoder, variational autoencoder and sliced-wasserstein autoencoder. In the representation space, the capability of separating different ultrasound patches as well as recognizing similar patches is investigated and compared based on a dataset of liver images. Two metrics to evaluate the tracking capability in the representation space are proposed. It is shown that ultrasound patches with different anatomical structures can be distinguished and sets of similar patches can be clustered in representation space. The results indicate that the investigated autoencoders have different levels of usability for target tracking in 3DUS.')

        abstract='We propose a deep learning clustering method that exploits dense features from a segmentation network for emphysema subtyping from computed tomography (CT) scans. Using dense features enables high-resolution visualization of image regions corresponding to the cluster assignment via dense clustering activation maps (dCAMs). This approach provides model interpretability. We evaluated clustering results on 500 subjects from the COPDGene study, where radiologists manually annotated emphysema sub-types according to their visual CT assessment. We achieved a 43% unsupervised clustering accuracy, outperforming our baseline at 41% and yielding results comparable to supervised classification at 45%. The proposed method also offers a better cluster formation than the baseline, achieving 0.54 in silhouette coefficient and 0.55 in David-Bouldin scores.')

        abstract="In personalized prosthesis shaping, the desired shape remains typically unknown and has to be estimated based on the individual pathological shape. This estimation is also called pseudo healthy synthesis. One example application is the personalization of aortic root prostheses during valve-sparing aortic root surgery. Even though several methods for pseudohealthy synthesis were proposed during the last years, it might not always be necessary to taylor a completely individual and unique prosthesis for each and every patient as this introduces high costs and regulatory issues. Another option is to identify a set of prosthesis types that represents all natural healthy shapes in an adequate way. Then, the pseudohealthy synthesis problem becomes a classification problem, aiming on predicting the optimal prosthesis out of the set of candidates given a pathological shape.In this work, we present a fully automized workflow of unsupervised shape typification and type classification based on pathological data for the example of personalizing aortic root prostheses shapes. We provide a proof-of-concept study on an ex-vivo porcine data set, including a thorough evaluation of the model\\'s hyperparameters and the number of identified shape types. Our study lies the groundwork for a new branch of personalized prosthesis shaping with a high potential of translation to clinical application: Discrete Pseudohealthy Synthesis.")

Existing works showed that anomalies are localized in small-sized knee regions that appear in particular areas of MRI scans. Based on such facts, MRPyrNet exploits a Feature Pyramid Network to enhance small appearing features and Pyramidal Detail Pooling to capture such relevant information in a robust way. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets demonstrate that MRPyrNet improves the ACL tear and meniscal tear diagnosis capabilities of two state-of-the-art methodologies.

        abstract="Ensuring the privacy of research participants is vital, even more so in healthcare environments. Deep learning approaches to neuroimaging require large datasets, and this often necessitates sharing data between multiple sites, which is antithetical to the privacy objectives. Federated learning is a commonly proposed solution to this problem. It circumvents the need for data sharing by sharing parameters during the training process. However, we demonstrate that allowing access to parameters may leak private information even if data is never directly shared. In particular, we show that it is possible to infer if a sample was used to train the model given only access to the model prediction (black-box) or access to the model itself (white-box) and some leaked samples from the training data distribution. Such attacks are commonly referred to as \\textit{Membership Inference attacks}. We show realistic Membership Inference attacks on deep learning models trained for 3D neuroimaging tasks in a centralized as well as decentralized setup. We demonstrate feasible attacks on brain age prediction models (deep learning models that predict a person\\'s age from their brain MRI scan). We correctly identified whether an MRI scan was used in model training with a 60% to over 80% success rate depending on model complexity and security assumptions.")

        abstract='Diffeomorphic and deforming autoencoders have been recently explored in the field of medical imaging for appearance and  shape disentanglement. Both models are based on the deformable template paradigm, however they show different weaknesses for the representation of medical images. Diffeomorphic autoencoders only consider spatial deformations, whereas deforming autoencoders also  regard changes in the appearance, however no uniform template is generated for the whole training dataset, and the appearance is modeled depending on a very few parameters. In this work, we propose a method that represents images based on a global template, where next to the  spatial displacement, the appearance is modeled as the pixel-wise intensity difference to the unified template. To however ensure that the generated appearance offsets adhere to the template shape,  a guided filter smoothing of the appearance map is integrated into an end-to-end training process. This regularization significantly improves the disentanglement of shape and appearance and thus enables multi-modal image modeling. Furthermore, the generated templates are crisper and the registration accuracy improves. Our experiments also show applications of the proposed approach in the field of automatic population analysis.

        abstract='The segmentation of cardiac structures in Cine Magnetic Resonance imaging (CMR) plays an important role in monitoring ventricular function, and many deep learning solutions have been introduced that successfully automate this task. Yet due to variabilities in the CMR acquisition process, images from different centers or acquisition protocols differ considerably. This causes deep learning models to fail silently. It is therefore crucial to identify out-of-distribution (OOD) samples for which the trained model is unsuitable. For models with a self-supervised proxy task, we propose a simple method to identify OOD samples that does not require adapting the model architecture or access to a separate OOD dataset during training. As the performance of self-supervised tasks can be assessed without ground truth information, it indicates during test time when a sample differs from the training distribution. The proposed method combines a voxel-wise uncertainty estimate with the self-supervision information. Our approach is validated across three CMR datasets and two different proxy tasks. We find that it is more effective at detecting OOD samples than state-of-the-art post-hoc OOD detection and uncertainty estimation approaches.')
