        abstract='The clinical Atrial Fibrillation (AF) visualization method, multi-electrode mapping (MEM), delivers electrode grid in-vivo to the heart muscle and is known for its low resolution. A more cutting-edge imaging modality, near-infrared optical mapping (NIOM), allows seeing the AF sources in high resolution; however, it is currently ex-vivo only (i.e., designed for explanted organs only). In this work, we present the ex-vivo to the in-vivo learning paradigm, where the former serves the purpose of improving the latter. Specifically, the NIOM improves the detection of AF sources in MEM data via an image-to-image model. We validate the idea on 7 explanted human hearts and test the models on 2 clinical cases.')

        abstract='Geometric deep learning has recently gained influence, as it allows the extension of convolutional neural networks to non euclidean domains. In this paper graph neural networks (GNNs) are used for reconstruction and coil combination of undersampled concentric-ring k-space MRSI data. We show that graph U-nets perform better on undersampled data than GNNs. Specifically, results suggest that the omission of self-connecting edges results in a more stable behavior and better training for graph U-nets.')

        abstract='MRI is an inherently slow process, which leads to long scan time for high-resolution imaging. The speed of acquisition can be increased by ignoring parts of the data (undersampling). Consequently, this leads to the degradation of image quality. This work proposes a deep learning based MRI reconstruction framework to reconstruct highly undersampled Cartesian or radial MR acquisitions, which includes a modified regularised version of ResNet as the network backbone to remove artefacts from the undersampled image, followed by data consistency steps that fusions the network output with the data already available from undersampled k-space in order to further improve reconstruction quality. The performance of this framework for various undersampling patterns has also been tested, and it has been observed that the framework is robust to deal with various sampling patterns - results in very high quality reconstruction (highest SSIM being 0.990 +/-0.006 for acceleration factor of 3.5), while being compared with the fully sampled reconstruction. It has been shown that the proposed framework can successfully reconstruct even for an acceleration factor of 20 for Cartesian (0.968 +/-0.005) and 17 for radially (0.962 +/-0.012) sampled data.')

        abstract='Low dose 2D scouts, also known as topograms, are commonly used for CT scan planning. Although 3D CT volumes can provide more valuable information for the selection of the scan range and parameters, the very low X-ray dose used during scout scan acquisitions results in artefacts requiring effective denoising techniques to make them useful. This has proved challenging for traditional denoising algorithms. We propose a projection domain denoiser based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), which provides improved image quality even at ultra-low dose levels. We compare two CNNs operating on two data representations, a conventional line integral data and raw photon counts, which have different quantitative properties and dynamic ranges. The results show that the two denoising strategies give rise to different properties of reconstructed images and that both projection CNNs are effective for ultra-low dose CT denoising.')

        abstract='In this work, we propose the use of Recurrent Inference Machines (RIMs) to perform T1 mapping. The RIM is a neural network framework that learns an iterative inference process using a model of the signal, similar to conventional statistical methods for quantitative MRI (QMRI), such as the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE). Previously, RIMs were used to solve linear inverse reconstruction problems. Here, we show that they can also be used to optimize non-linear problems. The developed RIM framework is evaluated in terms of accuracy and precision and compared to an MLE method and an implementation of the ResNet. The results show that, compared to the other techniques in Monte Carlo experiments with simulated data, the RIM improves the precision of estimates without compromising in accuracy.')

        abstract='During the COVID-19 pandemic, rapid and accurate triage of patients at the emergency department is critical to inform decision-making. We propose a data-driven approach for prediction of deterioration risk using a deep neural network that learns from chest X-ray images, and a gradient boosting model that learns from routine clinical variables. Our AI prognosis system, trained using data from 3,661 patients, achieves the AUC of 0.786 (95% CI: 0.742-0.827) when predicting deterioration within 96 hours. Our deep neural network indicates informative areas of chest X-ray images to assist clinicians in interpreting the predictions, and performs comparably to two experienced chest radiologists in a reader study. In summary, our findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed system for assisting front-line physicians in the triage of COVID-19 patients.')

        abstract="Discovering the brain progression over a lifetime is beneficial for identifying the subject affected by neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD) which require detection at the earliest possible time for the sake of delaying the progression by the virtue of particular treatments. As brain progressions in terms of both normal aging and AD-pathology tend to be entangled to each other, distinguishing the progression pathways of AD over the normal aging brains is quite an intricate task. To this end, we propose Prototypical Brain Maps (ProtoBrainMaps) for modeling the AD progressions through the established prototypes in the latent space via clinically-guided topological maps. Having devised as an interpretable network, it possesses the ability to establish and synthesize a set of well-interpolated prototypical brains, each corresponding to certain health conditions in terms of neurodegenerative diseases.")

        abstract='High-density objects in the field of view, still remain one of the major challenges in CTimage reconstruction. They cause artifacts in the image, which degrade the quality andthe diagnostic value of the image. Standard approaches for metal artifact reduction areoften unable to correct these artifacts sufficiently or introduce new artifacts. In this work,a new deep learning approach for the reduction of metal artifacts in CT images is proposedusing a Generative Adversarial Network. A generator network is applied directly to theprojection data corrupted by the metal objects to learn the corrected data. In addition, asecond network, the discriminator, is used to evaluate the quality of the learned data. Theresults of the trained generator network show that most of the data could be reasonablyreplaced by the network, reducing the artifacts in the reconstructed image.')

        abstract='The contrast settings to select before acquiring magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal depend heavily on the subsequent tasks. As each contrast highlights different tissues, automated segmentation tools for example might be optimized for a certain contrast. While for radiotherapy, multiple scans of the same region with different contrasts can achieve a better accuracy for delineating tumours and organs at risk. Unfortunately, the optimal contrast for the subsequent automated methods might not be known during the time of signal acquisition, and performing multiple scans with different contrasts increases the total examination time and registering the sequences introduces extra work and potential errors. Building on the recent achievements of deep learning in medical applications, the presented work describes a novel approach for transferring any contrast to any other.The novel model architecture incorporates the signal equation for spin echo sequences, and hence the model inherently learns the unknown quantitative maps for proton density, T1 and T2 relaxation times (PD, T1 and T2, respectively). This grants the model the ability to retrospectively reconstruct spin echo sequences by changing the contrast settings Echo and Repetition Time (TE and TR, respectively). The model learns to identify the contrast of pelvic MR images, therefore no paired data of the same anatomy from different contrasts is required for training. This means that the experiments are easily reproducible with other contrasts or other patient anatomies.Despite the contrast of the input image, the model achieves accurate results for reconstructing signal with contrasts available for evaluation. For the same anatomy, the quantitative maps are consistent for a range of contrasts of input images. Realized in practice, the proposed method would greatly simplify the modern radiotherapy pipeline. The trained model is made public together with a tool for testing the model on example images.')
