        abstract='Motility of the small intestine is a valuable metric in the evaluation of gastrointestinal disorders. Cine-MRI of the abdomen is a non-invasive imaging technique allowing evaluation of this motility. While 2D cine-MR imaging is increasingly used for this purpose in both clinical practice and in research settings, the potential of 3D cine-MR imaging has been largely underexplored. In the absence of image analysis tools enabling investigation of the intestines as 3D structures, the assessment of motility in 3D cine-images is generally limited to the evaluation of movement in separate 2D slices. Hence, to obtain an untangled representation of the small intestine in 3D cine-MRI, we propose a method to extract a centerline of the intestine, thereby allowing easier (visual) assessment by human observers, as well as providing a possible starting point for automatic analysis methods quantifying peristaltic bowel movement along intestinal segments. The proposed method automatically tracks individual sections of the small intestine in 3D space, using a stochastic tracker built on top of a CNN-based orientation classifier. We show that the proposed method outperforms a non-stochastic iterative tracking approach.')

        'Niharika Shimona Dsouza, Mary Beth Nebel, Deana Crocetti, Joshua Robinson, Stewart Mostofsky, Archana Venkataraman',

        abstract='We propose a multimodal graph convolutional network (M-GCN) that integrates resting-state fMRI connectivity and diffusion tensor imaging tractography to predict phenotypic measures. Our specialized M-GCN filters act topologically on the functional connectivity matrices, as guided by the subject-wise structural connectomes. The inclusion of structural information also acts as a regularizer and helps extract rich data embeddings that are predictive of clinical outcomes. We validate our framework on 275 healthy individuals from the Human Connectome Project and 57 individuals diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder from an in-house data to predict cognitive measures and behavioral deficits respectively. We demonstrate that the M-GCN outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines in a five-fold cross validated setting and extracts predictive biomarkers from both healthy and autistic populations. Our framework thus provides the representational flexibility to exploit the complementary nature of structure and function and map this information to phenotypic measures in the presence of limited training data.')

        abstract='Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that estimates magnetic susceptibility of tissue from MR phase measurements. Recently, several supervised deep learning (DL) techniques have demonstrated impressive performance in solving the challenging ill-posed field-to-source inverse QSM reconstruction problem. To address the lack of the inherent non-existent ground-truth QSM references, a model-based method was recently proposed using the well-established physical model. However, it fails to perform well at the regions with large susceptibility variations. Here, we proposed uQSM+ with data augmentation techniques to improve the model-based learning. The proposed method was evaluated on a multi-orientation QSM datasets and 2019 QSM reconstruction challenge datasets. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation showed that uQSM+ and zero-shot uQSM+ was capable of reconstructing high quality QSM. The code is available at \\inkhttps{https://github.com/juana313/uQSM-plus}.')
