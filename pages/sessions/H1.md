        abstract='A Hybrid Optimization Between Iterative and network fine-Tuning (HOBIT) reconstruction method is proposed to solve quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) inverse problem in MRI. In HOBIT, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is first trained on healthy subjects’ data with gold standard labels. Domain adaptation to patients’ data with hemorrhagic lesions is then deployed by minimizing fidelity loss on the patient training dataset. During test time, a fidelity loss is imposed on each patient test case, where alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) is used to split the time consuming fidelity imposed network update into iterative reconstruction and network update subproblems alternatively in ADMM, and only a subnet of the pre-trained CNN is updated during the process. Compared to the method FINE where such fidelity imposing strategy was initially proposed to solve QSM, HOBIT achieved both performance gain of reconstruction accuracy and vast reduction of computational time.')

        abstract='Exploiting the deep image prior property of convolutional auto-encoder networks is especially interesting for medical image processing as it avoids hallucinations by omitting supervised learning. Its spectral bias towards lower frequencies makes it suitable for inverse image problems such as denoising and super-resolution, but manual early stopping has to be applied to act as a low-pass filter. In this paper, we present a novel Bayesian approach to deep image prior using mean-field variational inference. This allows for uncertainty quantification on a per-pixel level and, given the right prior distribution on the network weights, omits the need for early stopping. We optimize the parameters of the weight prior towards reconstruction accuracy using Bayesian optimization with Gaussian Process regression. We evaluate our approach on different inverse tasks on a variety of modalities and demonstrate that an optimized weight prior outperforms former state-of-the-art Bayesian deep image prior approaches. We show that a badly selected prior leads to worse accuracy and calibration and that it is sufficient to optimize the weight prior parameter per task domain.')

        abstract='Subject motion is one of the major challenges in clinical routine MR imaging. Despite ongoing research, motion correction has remained a complex problem without a universal solution. In advanced quantitative MR techniques, such as MR Fingerprinting, motion does not only affect a single image, like in single-contrast MRI, but disrupts the entire temporal evolution of the magnetization and causes parameter quantification errors due to a mismatch between the acquired and simulated signals. In this work, we present a deep learning-empowered retrospective motion correction for rapid 3D whole-brain multiparametric MRI based on Quantitative Transient-state Imaging (QTI). We propose a patch-based 3D multiscale convolutional neural network (CNN) that learns the residual error, i.e. after initial navigator-based correction, between motion-affected quantitative T1, T2 and proton density maps and their motion-free counterparts. For efficient model training despite limited data availability, we propose a physics-informed simulation to apply continuous motion-patterns to motion-free data. We evaluate the performance of the residual CNN on 1.5T and 3T MRI data of ten healthy volunteers. We analyze the generalizability of the model when applied to real clinical cases, including pediatric and adult patients with large brain lesions. Our study demonstrates that image quality can be significantly improved after correcting for subject motion. This has important implications in clinical setups where large amounts of motion affected data must be discarded.')
