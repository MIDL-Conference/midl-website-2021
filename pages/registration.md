# Registration is now open!

The Covid-19 pandemig is ongoing and we are closely monitoring the situation. Unfortunately, it will not be possible to host MIDL as a hybrid event. Our location will still be in use as a vaccination centre. Furthermore, current regulations do not allow any conference-like meetings. Consequently, MIDL 2021 will take place as a **fully virtual meeting**. For further questions please send an email to [registration@2021.midl.io](mailto:registration@2021.midl.io).

* **Students:** We offer student discounts. To prove your student status, please provide a signed letter from supervisor (or other official) or a copy of your student ID. You need to be a full-time student at the time of registration.
<!--* **PostDocs:** We offer a discount for early-career postdoctoral researchers (max. two years after degree conferral) when registering for virtual participation. To prove your status, please provide an official document stating the date your degree was conferred.-->

**Scholarships:**
MIDL aims at providing as open as possible access to scientific research. Especially early career scientists in/from lower income countries without extensive travel funding may struggle to pay for conference fees. 
We therefore have a limited amount of scholarships in the form of registration fee waivers for student attendees. The selection process is aimed to balance the academic profile, motivation, and diverse background. 
Therefore students from low income countries will be preferred. To apply please use [this application form](https://forms.gle/G8Vdr1Li2WGUJSny5) by July 2nd.

Validity of the submission will be judged by the conference organisers. Early short paper submissions may be updated until the standard submission deadline and will follow the same review / decision process and timeline as any other short paper. Early submissions must be performed through the normal submission procedure using OpenReview, additionally, an email linking to the submission and asking for an invitation letter should be sent to [2021@midl.io](mailto:2021@midl.io). //-->
