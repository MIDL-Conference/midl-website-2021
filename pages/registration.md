Validity of the submission will be judged by the conference organisers. Early short paper submissions may be updated until the standard submission deadline and will follow the same review / decision process and timeline as any other short paper. Early submissions must be performed through the normal submission procedure using OpenReview, additionally, an email linking to the submission and asking for an invitation letter should be sent to [2021@midl.io](mailto:2021@midl.io).
