    <span class="abstract">
        We present a deep learning (DL) registration framework for fast mono-modal and multi-modal image registration using differentiable mutual information and diffeomorphic B-spline free-form deformation (FFD). Deep learning registration has been shown to achieve competitive accuracy and significant speedups from traditional iterative registration methods. In this paper, we propose to use a B-spline FFD parameterisation of Stationary Velocity Field (SVF) to in DL registration in order to achieve smooth diffeomorphic deformation while being computationally-efficient. In contrast to most DL registration methods which use intensity similarity metrics that assume linear intensity relationship, we apply a differentiable variant of a classic similarity metric, mutual information, to achieve robust mono-modal and multi-modal registration. We carefully evaluated our proposed framework on mono- and multi-modal registration using 3D brain MR images and 2D cardiac MR images.
