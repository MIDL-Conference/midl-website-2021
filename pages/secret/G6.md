    <span class="abstract">
        MRI-based prediction models are one of the most exploited AI solutions in neurology. Numerous computer-vision models showed their predictive ability for diverse psychoneurological conditions. Although most of these models are based on weak or no annotation, only a few reported studies interpret the predictions and perform the model saliency regions\' analysis.We utilize 3DCNN interpretation with GradCAM to explore learned patterns for basic demographic characteristics prediction on the healthy cohort. We compare the saliency maps of the gender prediction models with the different types of MRI data preprocessing and augmentation. We assess the quality of learned patterns and examine the ways of models overfitting. We propose a data augmentation strategy based on optimal transport to avoid model overfitting on the brain volumes.
