    <span class="abstract">
        Hyperpolarized gas MRI can visualize and quantify regional lung ventilation with exquisite detail but requires highly specialized equipment and exogenous contrast. Alternative, non-contrast techniques, including CT-based models of ventilation have shown moderate spatial correlations with hyperpolarized gas MRI. Here, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates CT-ventilation modelling and deep learning approaches. The hybrid model/DL framework generated synthetic ventilation images which accurately replicated gross ventilation defects in hyperpolarized gas MRI scans, significantly outperforming other model- and DL-only approaches. Our results show that a synergy between conventional CT-ventilation modelling and DL can improve the performance of functional lung image synthesis.
