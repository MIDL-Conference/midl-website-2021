    <span class="abstract">
        A Hybrid Optimization Between Iterative and network fine-Tuning (HOBIT) reconstruction method is proposed to solve quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) inverse problem in MRI. In HOBIT, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is first trained on healthy subjects’ data with gold standard labels. Domain adaptation to patients’ data with hemorrhagic lesions is then deployed by minimizing fidelity loss on the patient training dataset. During test time, a fidelity loss is imposed on each patient test case, where alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) is used to split the time consuming fidelity imposed network update into iterative reconstruction and network update subproblems alternatively in ADMM, and only a subnet of the pre-trained CNN is updated during the process. Compared to the method FINE where such fidelity imposing strategy was initially proposed to solve QSM, HOBIT achieved both performance gain of reconstruction accuracy and vast reduction of computational time.
