    <span class="abstract">
        We present the first place recognition system trained specifically for colonoscopy sequences. We use the convolutional neural network for image retrieval proposed by Radenovic et al. and we fine-tune it using image pairs from real human colonoscopies. The colonoscopy frames are clustered automatically by a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) algorithm, which has proven to cope with scene deformation and illumination changes. The experiments show that the system is able to generalize by testing in a different human colonoscopy, retrieving frames observing the same place despite of the different viewpoint and illumination changes. The proposed place recognition would be a key component of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems operating in colonoscopy to assist doctors during the explorations or to support robotization.
