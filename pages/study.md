# Study Groups

New to MIDL 2021 and based on its success in recent IPMI conferences, we are introducing Study Groups: 
The mentor for a study group will meet for 45 minutes with a number of PhD students and jointly decide what questions might be of most interest for each paper in a session. 
This stimulates the live discussion and encourages younger MIDL members to actively participate. In addition, mentors can pass on some of your knowledge about the state-of-the-art in the field, the review process at MIDL, career advice and future challenges for research.

For attendees, the help of the mentor will support them in coming up with intriguing questions to ask at these group discussions. For many early-career scientists, it may be overwhelming to speak up yourself during a live session - being part of a study group makes it easier and also helps them meet new people in the field. 

While each group may flexibly decide upon an exact meeting time and space, we have allocated two slots per day in our conference schedule and special "study group" rooms in Gather.Town. These are 11:45 to 12:30 (UCT+2) for Europe/Africa/Asia, .. and 17:45 to 18:30 (ET, UCT-4) for Americas. See [Program](/program.html)
