    <span class="abstract">
        Radiotherapy dose simulation using the Monte-Carlo technique surpasses existing algorithms in terms of precision but remains too time-consuming to be integrated in clinical workflows. We introduce a 3D recurrent and fully convolutional neural network architecture to produce high-precision Monte-Carlo-like dose simulations from low-precision and cheap-to-compute ones. We use the noise-to-noise setting, a weakly supervised training strategy, by training the models solely on low-precision data without expensive-to-compute, high-precision dose simulations. Several evaluation metrics are used to compare with other methods and to assess the clinical viability and quality of the generated dose maps.
