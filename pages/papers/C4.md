        Selecting task appropriate deep learning models is a resource intensive process; more so when working with large quantities of high dimensional data that are encountered in medical imaging. Model selection procedures that are primarily aimed at improving performance measures such as accuracy could become biased towards resource intensive models. In this work, we propose to inform and drive the model selection procedure using the carbon footprint of training deep learning models as a complementary measure along with other standard performance metrics. We experimentally demonstrate that increasing carbon footprint of large models might not necessarily translate into proportional performance gains, and suggest useful trade-offs to obtain resource efficient models.
