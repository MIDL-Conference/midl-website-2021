    <span class="abstract">
        Geometric deep learning has recently gained influence, as it allows the extension of convolutional neural networks to non euclidean domains. In this paper graph neural networks (GNNs) are used for reconstruction and coil combination of undersampled concentric-ring k-space MRSI data. We show that graph U-nets perform better on undersampled data than GNNs. Specifically, results suggest that the omission of self-connecting edges results in a more stable behavior and better training for graph U-nets.
