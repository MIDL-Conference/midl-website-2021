    <span class="abstract">
        The clinical Atrial Fibrillation (AF) visualization method, multi-electrode mapping (MEM), delivers electrode grid in-vivo to the heart muscle and is known for its low resolution. A more cutting-edge imaging modality, near-infrared optical mapping (NIOM), allows seeing the AF sources in high resolution; however, it is currently ex-vivo only (i.e., designed for explanted organs only). In this work, we present the ex-vivo to the in-vivo learning paradigm, where the former serves the purpose of improving the latter. Specifically, the NIOM improves the detection of AF sources in MEM data via an image-to-image model. We validate the idea on 7 explanted human hearts and test the models on 2 clinical cases.
