    <span class="abstract">
        Accurately determining the molecular subtype of breast cancer is an important factor for the prognosis of breast cancer patients, and can guide treatment selection. In this study, we report a multimodal deep learning with attention mechanism (MDLA) for predicting the molecular subtypes of breast cancer from mammography and ultrasound images. Incorporation of the attention mechanism improved diagnostic performance for predicting 4-class molecular subtypes with Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.794. The MDLA can also discriminate between Luminal disease and non-luminal disease with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.855. This work thus provides a noninvasive imaging biomarker to predict the molecular subtypes of breast cancer.
