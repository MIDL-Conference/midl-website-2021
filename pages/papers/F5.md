    <span class="abstract">
        In this work, we propose the use of Recurrent Inference Machines (RIMs) to perform $T_1$ mapping. The RIM is a neural network framework that learns an iterative inference process using a model of the signal, similar to conventional statistical methods for quantitative MRI (QMRI), such as the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE). Previously, RIMs were used to solve linear inverse reconstruction problems. Here, we show that they can also be used to optimize non-linear problems. The developed RIM framework is evaluated in terms of accuracy and precision and compared to an MLE method and an implementation of the ResNet. The results show that, compared to the other techniques in Monte Carlo experiments with simulated data, the RIM improves the precision of estimates without compromising in accuracy.
