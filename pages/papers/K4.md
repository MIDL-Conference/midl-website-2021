    <span class="abstract">
        The advancement of 7 Tesla MRI systems enabled the depiction of very small vessels in the brain. Segmentation and quantification of the small vessels in the brain is a critical step in the study of Cerebral Small Vessel Disease, which is a challenging task. This paper proposes a deep learning based on U-Net Multi-Scale Supervision architecture to automatically segment small vessels in 7 Tesla 3D Time-of-Flight (TOF) Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) data trained on a small imperfect semi-automatically segmented dataset and was made equivariant to elastic deformations in a self-supervised manner using deformation-aware learning to improve the generalisation performance. The proposed method achieved a dice score of 80.44 +/- 0.83 while being compared against the semi-automatically created labels and 62.07 while comparing against manually segmented region.
