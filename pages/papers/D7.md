    <span class="abstract">
        We extend the CycleGAN architecture with a style-based generator and show the efficacy of the proposed domain adaptation-based method between two histopathology image domains - Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) and HER2 immunohistochemically (IHC) images. Using the proposed method, we re-used large set of pre-existing annotations for detection of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), which were originally done on H&E, towards a TIL detector applicable on HER2 IHC images. We provide analytical validation of the resulting TIL detector. Furthermore, we show that the detected stromal TIL densities are significantly prognostic as a biomarker for patient stratification on a triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cohort.
