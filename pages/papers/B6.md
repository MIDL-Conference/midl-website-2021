    <span class="abstract">
        Diagnosis of cancer often relies on the time-consuming examination of histopathology slides by expert pathologists. Automation via supervised deep learning methods require large amounts of pixel-wise annotated data that is costly to acquire. Unsupervised density estimation methods that rely only on the availability of healthy examples could cut down the cost of annotation. We propose to use residual flows as density estimator and compare different tests for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. Our results suggest that unsupervised OOD detection is a viable approach for detecting suspicious regions in histopathology slides.
