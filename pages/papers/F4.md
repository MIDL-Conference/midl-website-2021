    <span class="abstract">
        Low dose 2D scouts, also known as topograms, are commonly used for CT scan planning. Although 3D CT volumes can provide more valuable information for the selection of the scan range and parameters, the very low X-ray dose used during scout scan acquisitions results in artefacts requiring effective denoising techniques to make them useful. This has proved challenging for traditional denoising algorithms. We propose a projection domain denoiser based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), which provides improved image quality even at ultra-low dose levels. We compare two CNNs operating on two data representations, a conventional line integral data and raw photon counts, which have different quantitative properties and dynamic ranges. The results show that the two denoising strategies give rise to different properties of reconstructed images and that both projection CNNs are effective for ultra-low dose CT denoising.
