    <span class="abstract">
        Discovering the brain progression over a lifetime is beneficial for identifying the subject affected by neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer\'s disease (AD) which require detection at the earliest possible time for the sake of delaying the progression by the virtue of particular treatments. As brain progressions in terms of both normal aging and AD-pathology tend to be entangled to each other, distinguishing the progression pathways of AD over the normal aging brains is quite an intricate task. To this end, we propose Prototypical Brain Maps (ProtoBrainMaps) for modeling the AD progressions through the established prototypes in the latent space via clinically-guided topological maps. Having devised as an interpretable network, it possesses the ability to establish and synthesize a set of well-interpolated prototypical brains, each corresponding to certain health conditions in terms of neurodegenerative diseases.
